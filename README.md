# PyElectroMan

A Python port of **Electro Man** (1992), also known as *Electro Body* — a cult classic platformer developed in Poland by xLand.

## About

PyElectroMan is an ongoing effort to recreate the original DOS game in Python. The project originated as a personal exercise to improve Python skills rather than as a path toward a commercial release.

The port is based on the original (unreleased) source code and uses art assets from the game, licensed under **CC BY-SA**.

## Project History

Development began years ago but went dormant for roughly 15 years due to the complexity of the original codebase — 30+ years old, difficult to parse, and challenging to translate accurately.

With the advent of AI-assisted development, the project has been revived as a testbed for **Claude Code**. Nearly all recent commits have been written by Claude Code.

## Development Philosophy

- **Conversion accuracy over code quality** — the goal is to faithfully recreate original behavior, even when the source code is convoluted
- **Incremental progress** — given the complexity, exact 1:1 conversion may not be achievable
- **AI-assisted development** — exploring what's possible when AI handles the heavy lifting of legacy code translation

## Status

🚧 Work in progress — not intended as a playable release at this time.
